# Documentation Build Dependencies
#
# This folder contains required build tools and dependencies for generating
# documentation (e.g., DocFX, build tools, binaries). These files are kept
# available for the build process but excluded from version control to avoid
# storing large binary files in the repository.
#
# Build dependencies should be installed/downloaded as needed during the
# documentation build process.

# Ignore all files in this directory
*

# But keep this .gitignore file itself
!.gitignore
!.copilotignore
!README.md
